# 🏬 E-Commerce Data Warehouse Project

## 📖 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **Data Warehouse (DWH)** solution for an e-commerce platform. The workflow simulates a real-world scenario involving messy operational data, Excel-driven dimensional modeling, a full ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow, and insightful BI dashboards.

Key highlights:

- **Dirty RDBMS schema** with 15 tables and 5K–30K rows each, totaling ~500MB–1GB
- Common data issues include: entry errors, missing values, inconsistencies, and type mismatches
- **Excel analysis** for designing a robust star schema
- **ETL pipeline** using Apache Airflow for ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and loading to Snowflake
- **BI dashboard** for visualizing KPIs and business insights
- **Pipeline updates** with additional dirty data to simulate growth and monitor KPI changes over time
